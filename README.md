# PaymentApplication
This is my work through the egFWD Initiative with Udacity - Embedded Systems Professional Track.

Payment systems are now available everywhere and everyone interacts with these systems every day.

There are different types of transactions you can make, SALE, REFUND, Pre-Authorization, and VOID.

- SALE: means to buy something and its price will be deducted from your bank account.
- REFUND: this means that you will return something and wants your money back to your bank account.
- Pre-Authorization: means holding an amount of money from your account, e.g Hotel reservation.
- VOID: this means canceling the transaction, e.g if the seller entered the wrong amount.


You are required to implement the SALE transaction only by simulating the card, terminal(ATM), and the server.


**The project can be distributed over 6 main tasks:**


1. Development environment preparation
2. Implement the card module
3. Implement the terminal module
4. Implement the server module
5. Implement the application
6. Testing the application
